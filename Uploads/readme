Looking for the files to run Supernova? 
You probably want to go to the Releases page and get the latest zip from there.

However, you can still download the required files from here. You need these files:
Supernova.exe, SupernovaCLI.exe, Supernova_.dll


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supernova_infid.dll is a special version of Supernova which increases maximum id in /gb and /lb from 255 to 767.
Replace Supernova_.dll with this file (i.e. rename it to Supernova_.dll) to use it.

You probably don't want this version though, because it slightly reduces performance.
Using a block over 255 will also make the map use twice as much memory in the client.

YOU WERE WARNED!
